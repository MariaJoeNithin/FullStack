3.Scenario: You have a div with the class "container" and you want to set its height to be equal to 100% of the viewport height. Which CSS property would you use?


   If my understanding is correct and the default height of a div where no height is specified is auto 
   then this is not possible without setting an explicit height on the containing div. 
   If an explicit height is set on the containing div then height:100% on the contained div will mean that it grows to the height of the container.


2.Scenario: You have an image with the class "avatar" and you want to apply a border to it when a user hovers over it. How would you write the CSS selector for the hover state?
  
    .avatar:hover{
       }

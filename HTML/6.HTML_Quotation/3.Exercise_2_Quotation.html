        <blockquote>Good for normal use but not built for gaming especially multiplayer games</blockquote><br>
        <cite>Oscar Wikde</cite><br><hr>
        <blockquote>Looks good and sound quality is also better</blockquote><br>
        <cite>Albert</cite><br><hr>
        <blockquote>It's not able to provide a good quality of audio while communicating with someone in call in PC.<br>
            Specially in discord and games like VALORANT and othe multiplayer games.<br>
            In short you can't talk and hear the sound of the game at the same time, and if you try forcefully to hear it the quality drops significantly.</blockquote><br>

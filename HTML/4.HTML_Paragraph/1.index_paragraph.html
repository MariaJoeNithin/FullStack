            <p>Hello . Welcome to Skill Safari . We have a class about Full Stack Development . 
                Full Stack development is a complete Development of a Website. It is a combination of both front end and Back end.
                A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a website.
                The front end (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and 
                the back end (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill sets.</p>

            <p>I wish to visit here atleast once.Japan is a country filled with years of culture and tradition.<br> It is also a country that puts a large emphasize on the workings of its business world. Japanâ€™s tourism is driven by its unique culture and business prospects.
                <br> In the Japanese economy, tourism is not as influential as other sources of revenue but it is still substantial. In Japan, tourism and business travel, in Japan, is mostly domestic.</p>

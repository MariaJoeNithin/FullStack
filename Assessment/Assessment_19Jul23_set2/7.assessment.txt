Advantages of Infinite Scroll Pagination.
It improves the user engagement and retention, as the user can easily access more content without interrupting their flow or leaving the page.
It reduces the server load and bandwidth, as the content is only loaded when needed and not all at once.
It simplifies the user interface and eliminates the need for pagination controls, such as buttons or links, which can take up space and clutter the page.

Disadvantages:
1.It can affect the performance and memory usage of the browser, as more content is added to the DOM and needs to be rendered and processed.
2.It can make it difficult for the user to find or return to a specific item or position in the list, as there is no clear indication of where they are or how much content is available.
3.It can interfere with the browserâ€™s native scrolling behavior and features, such as the back button, bookmarks, or history.
4.It can create accessibility issues for users who rely on keyboard navigation or screen readers, as they may not be able to access or perceive the new content.
